#GAccordion

GAccordion is a reusable accordion component that depends on accordion.js and accordion.css (or accordion.scss).

## Getting started

Declare a div element and create a GAccordion object 


## What to improve

1. error handling (both JS and HTML element overflow)
2. max-height animation animation (should fix with js-measured height)
